# budget-tracker-task

Usable budget tracker app. 
Add this month's budget to the top by pressing the "Edit budget" button. 
The budget you entered will be shown on the top. As you add entries with the "add an entry" button, the remaining budget will be updated based on the sum of added entries.
Each entry has a description that can optionally be added. Each entry is also editable.
The budget and the entries are stored in a database, so that they are saved and reloaded upon next launch.
